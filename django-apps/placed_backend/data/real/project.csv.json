            "brief": "Workshop activity is a feature that Moodle offers to run peer assessment. This is something that universities and schools are using more every day across the World. However, traditional peer assessment has some educational and perceptual limitations that UCL Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering department in collaboration with the Institute of Education has addressed with the development of the so called \u201c360 degrees peer assessment method\u201d. Moodle Workshop Activity is currently unable to support this method entirely, but few additional features would make it suitable. David Mudrak, the developer of Workshop Activity, is keen on adding these features to the global Moodle and has requested that we provide a patch. This project will aim to the development of such patch for its integration in Moodle core code. Description of the specific required changes were discussed in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46726?jql=issuetype%20in%20%28Improvement%2C%20%22New%20Feature%22%29%20AND%20text%20~%20workshop",

It allows a relatively quick qualitative assessment of the different cognitive domains and therefore helps in diagnosing cognitive impairment, and particularly helps in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Currently only available in a small book form, developing this assessment into a simple-to-use app with added capacity for response analysis, including response times and speech recognition, as well as summary data with explanations of the results, would increase its availability and ease of use not only for secondary care physicians but also general practitioners across the UK. The assessment contains tests for different cognitive domains that will require different types of interactive element. The sections will therefore be split between two student teams.",

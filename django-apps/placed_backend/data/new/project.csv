1,Drug chart app,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"Create a web application as a learning tool for medical students in Years 4, 5, and 6 on Management of Drug Charts used by Consultant and doctors to be able to understand, edit, and correct the details provided in the chart for various medical specialties, the main criteria being usability and ease of data management.",,,3,,,4,227,"6,14,32",,227,,1,,1,11
2,Fixed biological marker detection,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,The current way of screening for tuberculosis delivers a dose of RT23 under the skin and is left for 48-72 hours and a person who has been exposed to the TB bacteria will display an immune response. This is measured by a healthcare professional who examines the hardened area in mm to determine the diagnosis. Developing an app that could use a smartphone’s camera to work out the size of swelling and use that as a diagnostic tool would remove some human error from the process and also mean the patient would not need to return to the clinic.,,,3,,,4,211,,,211,,1,,2,3
3,Workshop Activity with option for 360 degrees peer assessment.,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"Workshop activity is a feature that Moodle offers to run peer assessment. This is something that universities and schools are using more every day across the World. However, traditional peer assessment has some educational and perceptual limitations that UCL Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering department in collaboration with the Institute of Education has addressed with the development of the so called “360 degrees peer assessment method”. Moodle Workshop Activity is currently unable to support this method entirely, but few additional features would make it suitable. David Mudrak, the developer of Workshop Activity, is keen on adding these features to the global Moodle and has requested that we provide a patch. This project will aim to the development of such patch for its integration in Moodle core code. Description of the specific required changes were discussed in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46726?jql=issuetype%20in%20%28Improvement%2C%20%22New%20Feature%22%29%20AND%20text%20~%20workshop",,,3,,,4,221,,,221,,1,,4,1

9,PsyBase,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"There are now several apps for referencing drugs and drug doses that have helped prevent medical errors and save lives, but there are currently none for the many measures used in mental health and neuropsychology despite the fact that important medical decisions often rely on their scores. For example, to test whether a treatment for depression is working, patients might be tested on the Beck Depression Inventory but there are several versions and clinical teams often struggle to remember the cut-off for severe depression, moderate depression and so on. There are many different measures all testing different aspect of mental health or neuropsychological function so an app that provides an easy-to-use database of measures as well as allowing scores to be easily interpreted would be an important healthcare tool and could be life-saving.",,,3,,,4,226,,,226,,1,,5,1
10,Queen Square screening test,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"The Queen Square Cognitive Assessment (known colloquially as 'The Green Book') was developed at the UCL Institute of Neurology and is used by neurologists across the UK as a short 'bedside' method of testing memory and cognition. It allows a relatively quick qualitative assessment of the different cognitive domains and therefore helps in diagnosing cognitive impairment, and particularly helps in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Currently only available in a small book form, developing this assessment into a simple-to-use app with added capacity for response analysis, including response times and speech recognition, as well as summary data with explanations of the results, would increase its availability and ease of use not only for secondary care physicians but also general practitioners across the UK. The assessment contains tests for different cognitive domains that will require different types of interactive element. The sections will therefore be split between two student teams.",,,3,,,4,201,,,201,,1,,4,1
11,Cognitive / mood bias app,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"We need an app that will present 16-17 year olds with images of faces, objects, landscapes and have them rate them for how much they think they are positive, negative or neutral.We would supply the images, but the app would need to provide a nice way of presenting the image and taking the ratings and storing the data. We then need a way of accessing this data for our analysis.",,,3,,,4,205,,,205,,1,,5,1
12,Voice & Health,,FALSE,9/28/2015,12/18/2015,"This app will contribute to research which tracks changes to a person's health and mental state over time. The idea is to perform longitudinal analysis on the person's voice by collecting samples of their speech on a regular basis to identify changes and anomalies. The app would prompt the user to make regular recordings and record answers to spoken questions about their health, fatigue, stress and so on. These recordings would then be uploaded to a server for acoustic analysis and to build a corpus for research",,,3,,,4,214,,,214,,1,,5,1

Additional functions help the person manage his/her own care, including medication reminders, healthcare appointment scheduling, and links to emergency services.",,,3,,,4,203,,,203,,1,,5,1

            "project_scope": "This module provides a thorough introduction to object-oriented (OO) programming and mobile application development. The first part of the module uses Java to give a grounding in key object-oriented concepts such as class design, inheritance, dynamic binding and interfaces. Material is also included on the implementation of core data structures such as lists, trees and hash tables, and on key development tools and practices.\nThe second part of the module focuses on applying the principles of OO programming in the development of apps via learning-by-doing and problem based learning (PBL) approaches. Several introductions to popular mobile and cloud/web service platforms are included, with continued emphasis on the OO approach to software development. User interface (UI) design and implementation is also introduced.\n\nThis is an intensely practical module and full student engagement outside of lectures and in lab classes is critical to successful completion of the module. To ensure that the process of designing and implementing mobile and cloud applications is fully understood, the module requires students to undertake a major group project where they must work with an external client to develop and deliver a working application. This takes students through all the stages of a software development project, applying the concepts taught via lectures and online material. Outcomes in addition to the software deliverable include real-world client engagement, team management and project documentation deliverables.\n\nThe project clients come from a wide range of backgrounds, including companies of all sizes, the NHS, academic organisations and charities. Each client defines an application that they have a real need for and will put into use. A successful project will not only deliver a working application but also have it ready either for distribution via an app store at their client\u2019s request or for handover as research materials. The interaction with clients to develop software meeting real-world needs is a unique and defining characteristic of this module, and provides students with a thorough introduction to the processes and challenges involved.",
